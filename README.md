My-Github-Pages-site

I started my web portfolio with my XD file I created in Ux Design class. I started by making the html first for all
the pages the worked my way onto the css. A lot of my challenges were with the css. I broke a lot of things....one thing
I found super hard was my navigation. Since I used a drop down for mobile and tablet I had to some how make it work as a
top regular nav for desktop. I had an issue where the logo would just vanish. I am still having issues with my icons being broken...
tried my best with the time I had. I did learn and get better with using grid. Im now able to use grid with almost no problems.
for ways I over came issues was I used the site 3w schools and I asked my friends kyler and andrew for some help as well as chris.

some images I used that were not mine per say was the social media icons the rest was all my work and my assests.
